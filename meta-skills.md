# Meta Skills

## How to Google like a programmer:

  - Include the language or library you are using
  - Check out the search tools 'past year'

  - For example: "javascript foreach object"

  - Google the exact error:
    - `ReferenceError: alert is not defined`


  - Look for three main kinds of solutions:

    1. Documentation
    2. Stack Overflow and other crowd sourced answers
    3. Blogs

## How to read a book on programming like a boss:

  1. Read / skim about the author. Who is this and why do I care?
  2. Skim the table of contents getting an overview of what its talking about.
  3. Read the table of contents more in depth, think about what you want to get out of it.
  4. Find a chapter that grabs your interest, skim that.
  5. Read until you can't anymore! Then do something totally different.

## How to succeed in this course:

  1. Believe in yourself, and believe in GA.
  2. Expose your ignorance.
  3. Work with other people as much as you can
  4. Reach out if you need anything! (You are struggling, bored, are looking for more good resources, having problems at home, anything.)
  6. Work really hard.
  7. Take care of your body and mind - more than usual. 

## Some guiding principles:

  1. Comprehension over memorization (you will always have Google). 
  2. First understand the why: Why did someone build this tool? What problem does it solve? This will help you understand the scope of what you are learning. 
  3. After that ask "How do I implement this? How do I use this tool to solve my problem?
  4. Once you know the answers to the questions, not before, you can allow yourself to ask things like "How can I customize this tool to do something else?" or "How was this tool built?"
